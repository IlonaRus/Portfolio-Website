          <p>
            At the beginning of this year, she made a conscious decision to make the switch to Frontend Developer and she is doing very well.
            She is continuously developing in our field, shows ambition, communicates well and, overall, is getting better at her profession. You notice this, for example, because she is increasingly able to tackle problems/stories independently.<br>
            She also plays a good role as a ScrumMaster within our team. I enjoy working with her.<br>
            Ilona continues to develop, goes ahead and if she doesn't have that feeling, then she raises the alarm. I think self-reflection is one of the most important indicators of growth.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mark Poelstra, superior TKP</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I don't really understand what she is doing but it looks like she is enjoying it.<br>I am very proud of her.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Egbert Rus, father</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            During her time at Oridna, Ilona has shown her ambition and talent. She has had a lot of added value within the department.<br>
            She learns quickly, comes up with new ideas and brings atmosphere to the floor.
            Her drive to develop further was clear and allowed her to make rapid progress.<br>
            A colorful person who is very passionate and ready to imporve herself everyday. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Meindert Jilderda, manager Ordina</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I don't like terms like junior, medior and senior. But compared to the average tester I know at DUO, I would absolutely not want to call her a junior. She has grown enormously, and is participating as if she has years of experience. She can be proud of this.<br>
            She thinks of everything to keep the team running smoothly, willingness to expand knowledge, and thus tasks in the team. Pleasant to deal with. Thinks about things that others forget. Clearly indicates how things are going.<br>
            I think she has learned a lot herself and has absolutely added value to the team.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maarten Hollenga, colleague DUO</li>
